* Usage

After starting the compose file, you will be able to access:

- Grafana: [[http://localhost:3000]] (username: ~admin~, password: ~foobar~)
- Prometheus: [[http://localhost:9090]]

With Prometheus pinging [[http://localhost:8000/metrics]] by default (this can be changed in the file ~prometheus/prometheus.yml~) and Grafana configured with Prometheus as a datasource.

Volumes presist data between docker compose restarts unless you ~docker compose down --volumes~.

Start up the compose file with:

#+begin_src bash
docker compose up

# grafana    => http://localhost:3000
# prometheus => http://localhost:9090


# grafana container shell:
# - docker compose exec grafana bash

# prometheus container shell:
# - docker compose exec prometheus sh
#+end_src

**N.B.**  You can set the password to update the `admin` user in ~grafana/config.monitoring~, it is set to ~foobar~ by default.
